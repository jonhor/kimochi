## Improvements

<!-- ## What I've accomplished

1. **Installing Astro**: First, I created a new Astro project and set up my online accounts.

2. **Making Pages**: I then learned how to make pages by creating new `.astro` files and placing them in the `src/pages/` folder.

3. **Making Blog Posts**: This is my first blog post! I now have Astro pages and Markdown posts!

### Some code
```shell
kubectl get all -n kimochi
```

### Ansible stuff
Configuring the server through ansible is also straightforward

```yaml
- name: Install helm
    shell: |
    curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/helm/helm/main/scripts/get-helm-3 | bash
    args:
    creates: /usr/local/bin/helm
```

## What's next

I will finish the Astro tutorial, and then keep adding more posts. Watch this space for more to come. -->
